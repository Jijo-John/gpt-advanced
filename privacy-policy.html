We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
</p>
<p>
We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
</p>

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Form Information.
</p>
<p>

When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide your information with 3rd parties
We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.

Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy services, stores, or assets. In such transactions, visitor information is usually one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that MARKWIZARD GLOBAL is acquired, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
